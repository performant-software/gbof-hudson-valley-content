      ## Arroz con Gandules Recipe (Spanish Rice with Pigeon Peas)


      Ingredients:


      2 tbsp of olive oil


      4 oz chopped ham or salted pork


      1/4 cup sofrito (seasoning popular in Puerto Rican cuisine)


      A pack of ‘sazone’ with ‘achiote’


      1 tbsp of tomato puree


      1 tsp of ground cumin


      1/2 tsp of oregano


      1 15-oz can of pigeon peas, drained and rinsed


      2 1/2 cups of long-grain rice, washed


      3 cups of chicken broth or plain water


      1/4 cup sliced olives stuffed with pimiento


      Enough salt and black pepper


      Cilantro for garnishing


      Instructions:


      Base Preparation: To begin, take a deep pan, place it on medium heat, and
      add a few tablespoons of olive oil. After that, add either a ham hock or
      salted pork to the pot and wait until it gets a brownish color. Once it is
      done, add a sofrito, sazón, tomato paste, cumin, and oregano; allow it to
      cook until fragrant, which takes around 2 minutes.


      Incorporate Gandules: Now, add the olives and pigeon peas into the pan,
      ensuring they come into contact with the spices.


      Mix in with Rice: Incorporate the rice into the mix; while doing so, make
      sure to mix them properly until each grain of rice is coated with the base
      paste.


      Proceed to Cook Rice: Add the chicken broth or water to the mixture. After
      it boils, lower the temperature. Cover it up and cook on low flame for 20
      to 25 minutes. The rice and all the liquid should now be absorbed and
      tender. Make sure to stir too frequently, which will make the rice mushy.


      Let it Sit and Serve: After removing it from the flame, give it a rest for
      5 minutes without touching it. Once the time has passed, stir it with a
      fork. If you want, add some cilantro on top and serve.


      Origins and Story


      Arroz con Gandules is a typical Puerto Rican dish that can be found on
      most holidays, family meetings, or any special event. My grandmother
      (Abuela) got the recipe from her mother (my great grandma) while living in
      the rural area where we grew in Puerto Rico since gandules were an
      important crop to grow there. The dish illustrates the melting pot of
      cultures in Puerto Rico: Taino, Spanish and African.


      In our family, this dish signifies home and jubilee. Together with pernil
      (roast pork) and pasteles, it is the main dish at our Nochebuena
      (Christmas Eve) dinner celebration. It truly is an example of the essence
      of the island’s culture since love goes into every ingredient that is
      included.

      The Bronx Zoo stands out as an exceptional urban, artistic, and cultural
      site by earning its rightful place in literature, art, and media. Its
      various ecosystems and wild animals have been the source of art, ranging
      from paintings and photography, while writers have featured the zoo in
      their novels as a tool to address issues about liberty, imprisonment, and
      animal-human relations. The cultural dimension of the zoo also underlines
      its relation to the Bronx, a community that seeks to preserve the City’s
      image as one endowed with beauty and vulnerability. Documentaries and
      films have also focused on the aspect of the zoo, portraying its role in
      the wider scope of wildlife and environmental education and demonstrating
      it as a focus in the media. Given the fact that the zoo is a focal point
      of nature, science, and culture, it can be argued that the Bronx Zoo has a
      huge impact and advances our understanding of the world.

      # Jacob Burns Film Center


      The Jacob Burns Film Center, located in Pleasantville, New York, is like a
      convenient package for cinephiles as it hosts an excess of indie films,
      documentaries, and international cinema. It is more than a theater —
      through film festivals, Q\&As with filmmakers, and other events, it allows
      attending films that look into different cultures, civilizations, and
      literary worlds. Viewing these films at JBFC has pleasantly surprised me
      as they demonstrate the significance of storytelling and the ways in which
      cinema relates to various issues and questions.

Fostering teamwork, discipline, understanding, and strength. For many families in Yonkers, it's a place where their children can achieve growth, hone their passions, and make memories. Gym Cats Gymnastics was my first job as a gymnastics coach, which solidified my decision to go into education and teaching. Gymcats taught me valuable lessons and helped me take a major step in my adult life, realizing the career I want.\n\nBecause of my work there, I could say I've been a teacher for years now because I teach a sport, discipline and self-control, and growth and confidence. Majoring in adolescent education now, the strategies and communication skills I have learned in the gym will remain with me for life. Working with children made me realize my “WHY” in life, and it was a blessing in disguise for me to realize my profession so young in life.\_\n"

      # Choate Gallery


      ![](https://res.cloudinary.com/dablecopc/image/upload/v1734943386/Samantha/AD_4nXevQltZsxRHsxa1ZQdWVyTi0oKUVj8GPLaHDKSJ9EQltJAyL4dPz6f9DMsueS0Dy6J_3EakgftaVNTO1vMzaP0NdBdeQO1hOa6iNFwLW0GMPWINTnj5zwTH_kjccso.png)The
      Choate Art Gallery was extremely interesting. Until this semester, I had
      no reason to visit and have never been to Choate. Meeting Mark Hogancamp
      was very exciting, and I enjoyed our time there. Having the privilege to
      ask him questions and hear his real-time responses is something I will
      always remember. Not to mention, learning about Mark Hogancamp was my
      favorite unit in class. The gallery building has a lot of history,
      meaning, and life.

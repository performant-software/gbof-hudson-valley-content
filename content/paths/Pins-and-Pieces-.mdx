    blurb: "# New Rochelle\n\n## Chocolate Chip Banana Bread\n\nTo my family, this recipe represents warmth and coming together in the cold months. This recipe has been passed down for so many years that we think it came from my great-great-grandmother. We haven't exactly changed the recipe, but the piece of paper is so old that it is now yellow, and you can tell there have been some spills on it.\n\n##### ![](https://res.cloudinary.com/dablecopc/image/upload/v1733754379/AD_4nXeShksw0NsPeJXcklSjLLLS969DfvmhmBKfaiGw9ZH9d0i1dMpyb7lnwHZwxQzw9CqWBHpLVNs26S1H7HhQZSK5maY3CKSGtfbzjjksnvbbSApnWo6lQTGn_bdwrjb.png)Recipe\n\n* 1 1/4 cup flour\n* 1/2 cup sugar\n* 1 stick margarine\n* 2 to 3 ripe bananas\_\n* 2 eggs\n* 1/2 tsp. salt\n* 1 tsp. baking soda\n* 1/2 to 3/4 cup chocolate chips\_\n\nInstructions:\_\n\nPreheat the oven to 350Â°.

      Davenport Beach Club was a major part of my childhood and personal growth.
      I started going there when I was still in elementary school and continue
      to go today. When I started going to Davenport Beach Club, I had a group
      of friends there that I was very close to. As we got older, the friend
      group started to fade. Davenport Beach Club signifies my journey of growth
      and transition to adulthood.

      # Choate Gallery


      I enjoyed going to Choate Art Gallery because it provides a place for
      artists to showcase their work.

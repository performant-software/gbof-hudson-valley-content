    blurb: "# Italy\n\n## ![](https://res.cloudinary.com/dablecopc/image/upload/v1734808177/crumbed-chicken-cutlet-ingredients_ad7im3.jpg)Chicken Cutlets\n\nThis recipe comes from my nonna, who immigrated to America when she was only 16. Growing up in such a big Italian family, learning about my family history, heritage, and importance, I have gotten the experience to see it all firsthand. For me, cooking isn't just something that feeds your body; it is much more. It is seeing someone's eyes light up, you’ve made them their favorite food, and sitting around the table with those you love most eating delicious food you’ve made together that has been passed down through generations.\n\n## Recipe\n\nIngredients for Chicken Cutlets:\n\n1. Cut the chicken cutlets paper-thin\n2. Egg wash\_\n3. Homemade bread crumb mixture with fresh herbs from the garden\n\nDirections:\_\n\nLay the chicken cutlet in the egg wash, then into the breadcrumb, and repeat that once more.\n\nLet the oil warm up, and drop a tiny piece in to make sure it is ready and hot.\n\nStart by only putting 3 cutlets in at a time.\n\nWhen golden brown and crispy, take it out and place it onto a paper towel on a rack. Serve hot and fresh after garnishing.\_\n\nMangia, magia!\n"

      I grew up in Eastchester, Westchester County, and this location accurately
      describes my upbringing, which I hold dearly. Many people in my town
      couldn't wait to leave the minute they graduated High School, but I never
      really understood why because Eastchester, as small as it is, has so much
      to offer. We have many important memorials, some of which I watched be
      built in one's honor. Above is a picture of the memorial for the baseball
      coach at Eastchester High, who passed away. it was built during my senior
      year of High School. When the news broke, you could feel the emotional
      heaviness in the school. His memorial shows the unity of the community and
      how the town comes together in difficult times and still comes together.
      The community in Eastchester is beautiful.

      # Choate Art Gallery


      The day our class visited the Choate Art Gallery, I was encapsulated by
      all the artwork around me. This was my first time visiting the gallery,
      and I loved every second. We learned about Hogancamp's work, and it was a
      true inspiration. Meeting the artist was another bonus that I thought was
      a unique experience. 


      While in the gallery, the photographer gave us a personal experience
      answering questions we had all prepared. Knowing his background beforehand
      and learning so much more from him in real life was cool. I was so happy
      when he brought his dolls to the gallery to show us that they aren’t just
      regular Barbie dolls but also ones he’s actually made. Seeing the props
      and behind-the-scenes of his unique and amazing artwork was so cool.

      # Portugal

      Last summer, I went to Portugal. My dad grew up in Portugal until he was
      10, we stayed at our house there which is the one he and his siblings grew
      up. Being in Portugal with my dad and his siblings, they took my cousins
      and me around and showed us what their lives used to look like. We don’t
      come from a town with a lot of much money, so they showed us how they used
      to clean clothes, walk miles for water, and so much more. As time has gone
      by, the town has become more technologically advanced, so not everything
      was there anymore. Still, the places my father took me in Portugal were
      some of the most beautiful things I had ever seen, and I felt fortunate to
      see and do all these things with my family the way my dad did. 


      I chose this photo of Portugal because the car represents the modern day
      while the buildings represent the past. I loved this ‘scene’ almost. It
      feels so quiet and comforting and looks like it will go on forever. I
      think this photo captures the beauty and mysteriousness that European
      countries hold, I felt like every street looked like this with very little
      modernization which made me absolutely fall in love with all the
      surroundings.

I am starting my arts and culture path with the most significant piece of culture that impacted me at a young age --  The Frank Lloyd Wright Smith House. My distant cousins and school teachers (Sara and Melvyn Smith) commissioned Frank Lloyd Wright to build their home.  The style of the house is similar to the Frank Lloyd Wright Usonian homes found in Pleasantville.

      The above picture is of Union City High School (UCHS), an important part
      of the city I grew up in. Although I did not personally attend UCHS, the
      school offers film classes and festivals, art showcases, plays and
      musicals, dance performances, and community spaces where my Girl Scout
      Troop met. These activities and offerings made the school environment
      welcoming to the community.

    blurb: >
      As a film major, I found the Jacob Burns Film Center an inspirational
      place to visit. The activities surrounding film techniques and setting
      were memorable and made me want to come back to visit. Before visiting
      this center with the class, I knew of it but had never gotten the chance
      to visit it myself. Getting a tour and seeing different theaters inside
      was a great experience and made me appreciate this small but influential
      place in Pleasantville. As someone who isn’t from the area, I had no idea
      such a place existed, and it allowed me to appreciate the town and what it
      has to offer for the community.

    blurb: "# Camp Half Blood\n\n#### A safe haven and training ground for demigods and supernatural characters.\n\nI included this imagined place on my personal cartography as the series it is from had a great impact on my childhood. I was a big fan of Rick Riordan’s book series, including Percy Jackson. Camp Half Blood is a fictional place in Percy Jackson’s world, and is a major point in the series plot.\_\n\n![](https://res.cloudinary.com/dablecopc/image/upload/v1733671015/Rosemarie/camp-half-blood_pa6bew.png)\n"

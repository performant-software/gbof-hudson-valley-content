My best guess is that this recipe originated during the communist times in Albania because it still works and tastes the same, even if you're missing an ingredient or two! The milk and mayonnaise were used to make it luxe, considering they didn't always have access to these ingredients.\n\nWhat you’ll need:\n\nTray\_\n\nBowl\n\nFork\_\n\nSpoon\n\nEgg(s)\n\nHalf glass of milk\n\nOlive oil\n\nMayonnaise\n\nSalt\n\nWhite Cornmeal\_\n\nCooking Spray\_\n\nMug\n"

I’ve written so many quotes along the walls, windowsills, and desks that it’s nice to wander around and find them. It’s so incredibly special to me, and I knew it would be since the first time I went in.\_\n"

      # John Cheever's Home


      ##### Ossining, New York


      When I saw that he lived in Ossining, an irrelevant town similar to my
      own, it kind of struck a chord in me. He’s so brilliant, and it amazed me
      to know that he had lived so close by. It was so beautiful, green, and
      secluded—truly the ideal home.

      # My Home


      ##### Bronx, New York


      I grew up in this home in the Bronx for most of my childhood. I have a lot
      of sweet memories here, reading late in my bottom bunk bed with my window
      open, playing basketball by myself on the sidewalk, and playing around
      with the kids whose parents owned the Chinese restaurant around the
      corner. The neighborhood is very different now, but growing up, it was
      good for what it was.

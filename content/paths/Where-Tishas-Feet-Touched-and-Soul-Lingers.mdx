      ## A Recipe of Value: Grandma’s Jamaican Escovitch Fish


      Recipe:


      Ingredients:


      2 whole snapper, cleaned


      1 cup vinegar


      1 onion, thinly sliced


      1 carrot, julienned


      1 scotch bonnet pepper, sliced


      1 tsp thyme


      2 cloves garlic, minced


      Salt and pepper to taste


      1 cup vegetable oil for frying


      Instructions:


      Season the fish with salt and pepper, then fry in oil until golden.


      In a separate pan, heat vinegar and add onions, carrots, garlic, thyme,
      and scotch bonnet. Simmer for 3 minutes.


      Pour the vinegar mixture over the fried fish and let marinate. Serve warm.


      Escovitch fish is a classic Jamaican dish with Spanish and African
      influences, showcasing the island’s rich cultural fusion. Its tangy, spicy
      flavors feel like a tasty representation of Jamaica’s bold spirit and
      culinary creativity. Over time, our family adapted the recipe for
      convenience, using fillets instead of whole fish or adjusting the spice
      level for younger children or guests--- a reflection of our life in a
      different country while keeping the core of the dish intact.
